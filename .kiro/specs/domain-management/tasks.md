## Notes

- Tasks marked with `*` are optional and can be skipped for faster MVP
- Each task references specific requirements for traceability
- Checkpoints ensure incremental validation throughout development
- Property tests validate universal correctness properties with minimum 100 iterations each
- Unit tests validate specific examples and edge cases
- The implementation follows TypeScript patterns established in the design document
