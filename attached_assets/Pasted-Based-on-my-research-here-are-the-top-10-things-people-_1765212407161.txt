Based on my research, here are the **top 10 things people want to change in website templates** to make them their own:

## 1. **Colors and Color Scheme**
People want to replace the template's default colors with their brand colors to ensure consistency across all marketing materials and improve brand recognition.

## 2. **Logo and Branding Elements**
Replacing the placeholder logo with their actual company logo and adjusting branding elements throughout the site is typically the first customization made.

## 3. **Text Content and Copy**
Changing all the dummy text to actual business information, including headlines, descriptions, about sections, and service descriptions.

## 4. **Images and Photography**
Swapping out stock photos with custom images that represent their actual products, services, team, or work to create authenticity.

## 5. **Fonts and Typography**
Adjusting font families, sizes, and text styles to match brand guidelines and improve readability, making the site feel more unique.

## 6. **Navigation Menu Structure**
Reorganizing the header navigation to reflect their specific pages, services, and site structure rather than using the template's default menu.

## 7. **Layout and Section Arrangement**
Reordering sections, removing unnecessary ones, or adding new sections to better showcase their unique content and services.

## 8. **Contact Information and Forms**
Updating all contact details, social media links, and customizing contact forms to capture the right information for their business needs.

## 9. **Mobile Responsiveness**
Fine-tuning how the site looks on mobile devices, often reordering elements differently than the desktop version for better mobile user experience.

## 10. **Footer Content**
Customizing copyright information, adding proper business details, social links, and ensuring the footer reflects their brand and legal requirements.

**Bonus Considerations:**
- Adding custom functionality (e-commerce, booking systems, membership areas)
- Optimizing for SEO (meta descriptions, page titles, schema markup)
- Improving page load speed by optimizing images and code

The key insight is that people want their template to look unique and reflect their brand identity rather than appearing generic or similar to competitors using the same template.
